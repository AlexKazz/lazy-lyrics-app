## How It Works

‚Ä¢ Lazy Lyrics uses the <a href="https://developer.musixmatch.com/">Musixmatch API</a> to grab lyric snippets based on text input.
<br/>
‚Ä¢ Due to API method parameter and data limitations, this process must be done in two separate API calls.
<br/>
‚Ä¢ When you submit a word, an API call is made from the Lazy Lyrics server (built on express) to the Musixmatch API.
<br/>
‚Ä¢ Information including <a href="https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/api-reference/track-search">artist, song title, and track ID</a> are returned.
<br/>
‚Ä¢ The track ID is then used to make a second Musixmatch API call to grab the <a href="https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/api-reference/track-snippet-get">lyric snippet</a>.
<br/>
‚Ä¢ Lazy lyrics generates a random index and random page number for each submission to provide ~100 different results for the same word.
<br/>
<br/>
_As this app is currently for personal use_ (not financed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), _it is subject to Musixmatch API <a href="https://developer.musixmatch.com/faq">daily data limits</a>. If you submit a word and nothing is returned, the data limit has been reached for that day and you can try again tomorrow._
